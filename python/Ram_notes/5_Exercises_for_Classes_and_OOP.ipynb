You may be able to overwrite the previous output [see this example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38540395/overwrite-previous-output-in-jupyter-notebook) but there are some differences between operating systems, it seems"

    "  - `balance`: the starting balance\n",
    "  - `interest_rate`: the interest rate e.g. 3.5% interest should be represented as 3.5\n",
    "- The class should implement the following:\n",
    "  - `withdraw(amount)`: If account balance is greater than (or equal to) amount, then balance is reduced by the amount, and returns the amount. Otherwise, balance is unchanged and zero is returned. If amount is negative than an exception is raised.\n",

    "  - `withdraw(amount)`: Same as StandardAccount behaviour, but also deducts a transcation fee. For example, `BadAccount(100, 2.5, 1.0)` initializes a bank account with a starting balance of 100, an interest rate of 2.5% and a transaction fee of 1% per transaction.  Every time a user withdraws from the `BadAccount`, a transaction fee proportional to the amount is taken. Negative balances are still prohibited\n",
    "- Create a class called `PremierAccount`. The class should be the same as the StandardAccount, except that it is initialized with `overdraft_limit`.\n",

    "  - A user can make withdrawals that leave them with a negative balance, provided that their balance does not exceed the overdraft limit. \n",
    "  - Every time the user makes a non-zero withdrawal that leaves them with a positive balance, they get a point. Every time they accumulate 5 points, £5 is added to the account balance.\n",
